CS 242 Project Part 4 Report 

All the multithreading that would be viewed from the client side has been tested and all the new classes have been added.
We need two classes for threading is because the whole idea behind multithreading is that the program is handling 
multiple tasks at once. And in order to run the multitasking we need classes from the clinet side the developer side. 
The separate class for client is to ensure the program is fully encapsulated and that the user does not modify any of 
the data. And also it is called listnered because it does not operate a method on any of the data. One thread cannot 
handle all the class because the meethods will be overloaded.
