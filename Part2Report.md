  All the methods were implemented in part 2 of the project after they were left unfilled. A new addition was the secure I/O streams to protect data from the users and ensure that the users can only access the methods. The outline and hierarchy had already been created for the methods but we needed to implement decrypt and encrypt methods for only classified users. And as always, all the test classes were separate as testing was done with the new filled methods.
